Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced text generation and understanding across multiple languages.
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms for better NLP performance and parallel processing.
Fine-tuning LLMs improves accuracy for specific domains like medicine, law, and finance.
Ethical AI involves fairness, transparency, accountability, and reducing bias in models.
Zero-shot learning allows LLMs to handle unseen tasks without additional training data.
Embedding techniques convert words into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
LLMs can assist in chatbots, content writing, code generation, and text summarization.
Evaluation metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity assess text quality and model performance.
The future of AI includes multimodal models integrating text, images, audio, and video.
Mistral AI optimizes LLM performance for efficiency with open-source models.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines document retrieval with LLM generation.
Vector databases store embeddings for efficient similarity search at scale.
Prompt engineering is crucial for getting accurate responses from language models.
Transfer learning enables knowledge from one task to be applied to related tasks.
Semantic search understands user intent beyond keyword matching.
